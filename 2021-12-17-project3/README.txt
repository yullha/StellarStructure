In this mini-project we compute the gravitational potential energy (GEP) for the
sun, using the Christensen-Dalsgaard model.

	1. The file trabajo3.pdf contains the problem description.
	   
	2. The file Sun_GEP.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that contains the 
	   problem solution.
	   
	   This jupyter noteboot was developed using Python3 and Jupiter 
	   Notebook 6.4.3.
	   
	   Furthermore, this Jupyter notebook can be directly visualized in 
	   Google Drive using the app Google Colab. However, to run the notebook
	   in Google Colab, it's necessary modify the notebook to read the file 
	   cptrho.l5bi.d.15c.
