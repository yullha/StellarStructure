## Radiative pressure vs Stellar Mass

In this mini-project we find the upper bound for the radiative pressure for different values of stellar masses.

	1. The file trabajo2.pdf contains the problem description.
	   	   
	3. The file Prad_vs_Mstar.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that contains the 
	   problem solution.
	   
	   This jupyter noteboot was developed using Python3 and Jupiter 
	   Notebook 6.4.3.
	   
	   Furthermore, this Jupyter notebook can be directly visualized in 
	   Google Drive using the app Google Colab. However, to run the notebook
	   in Google Colab, it's necessary modify the notebook to read the file 
	   cptrho.l5bi.d.15c.
